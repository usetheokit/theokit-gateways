**Every published export now carries documentation.** Forty-seven public symbols shipped with no docblock at all, so a consumer hovering `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`, `WhatsAppCloudBackend`, `ThreadStore` or any of the error classes got an empty tooltip. Coverage across the eleven packages went from 71.2% to 100% (163/163), measured over the published declarations rather than the source, because a docblock is not documentation until it survives the build.

The text says what each symbol is for and what constrains it, not what its name already says. `TelegramAdapter` records that a bot cannot enumerate its chats nor speak into one that has not spoken first. `DiscordAdapter` records that reading message content needs a privileged intent enabled in the developer portal, without which every `event.text` arrives empty and nothing says why. `WhatsAppWebBackend` records that it is unofficial and can get a number banned. `shouldDispatchSyncEvent` records that Matrix replays history on sync, which is why a freshly started bot would otherwise answer every message it can still see.

**`gateway-slack`'s README documented a type that does not exist.** Its usage example imported `GatewayMessageEvent` from `@theokit/gateway`. That name is an internal alias inside the Discord and Telegram adapters (`MessageEvent as GatewayMessageEvent`), never an export. A reader who copied the example got code that did not compile. It now imports `MessageEvent`, which is what `onInbound` actually hands the handler.

Two docblocks that attached to nothing were reattached: `acquirePidLock` in `gateway-whatsapp` had its documentation stranded thirty lines above, over a different function, and shipped undocumented as a result.
