# @theokit/gateway-agent

The glue between a TheoKit SDK agent and `@theokit/gateway` channels: run one turn to text, and
send text to a channel rendered for its platform. Peer dependencies: `@theokit/gateway`,
`@theokit/presenter`, `@theokit/sdk`.

## `runAgentText(agent, prompt, options?)`

Sends `prompt`, reads the stream through the presenter's `fromSdkMessage`, and concatenates the text.
Every send carries `toolResultGuard: { delimit: true }` (tool results reach the model framed as
data), merged over `options.sendOptions`.

```ts
const result = await runAgentText(agent, "What is on my calendar?");
if (result.ok) console.log(result.text);
else console.error(result.failure); // SDK error code, stream error code, or "no error code"
```

The turn failed when `wait()` reports `status: "error"` or the stream carried an error, even if
`wait()` says it finished. `text` holds whatever was streamed before the failure. `agent` is any
object matching `TurnAgent`, so tests can pass a fake.

## `deliverText(adapter, channelId, text)`

Renders `text` with `ChatPresenter` and `channelRendering(adapter.platform)`, then sends it with
`adapter.sendMessage`. Resolves `undefined` on success, or a short failure code: the adapter's refusal
code, or the thrown error's name. It never returns an error message or an id.

```ts
const failure = await deliverText(adapter, "C123", result.text);
```
