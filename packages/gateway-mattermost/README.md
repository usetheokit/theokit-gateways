# @theokit/gateway-mattermost

Mattermost platform adapter for [`@theokit/gateway`](../gateway).

Works with self-hosted Mattermost (Docker / Kubernetes / bare metal) and Mattermost Cloud. WebSocket gateway for real-time inbound, REST v4 for outbound.


## How inbound arrives

**WebSocket.** The adapter subscribes to the server's event socket; messages reach `onInbound` once
`connect()` resolves. There is no webhook to host and nothing for an application to authenticate.

Mattermost's platform does offer outgoing webhooks and slash commands. This adapter does not use
them, so nothing here validates one.
## Install

```bash
pnpm add @theokit/sdk @theokit/gateway @theokit/gateway-mattermost
pnpm add @mattermost/client ws
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { Agent } from "@theokit/sdk";
import { GatewayRunner } from "@theokit/gateway";
import { MattermostAdapter } from "@theokit/gateway-mattermost";

const adapter = new MattermostAdapter({
  baseUrl: "https://mattermost.acme.com",
  accessToken: process.env.MM_BOT_TOKEN!,
  // Optional: ignore non-DM channels unless explicitly mentioned (default: true).
  // requireMention: true,
});

const runner = new GatewayRunner({
  adapters: [adapter],
  handler: async (event, ctx) => {
    if (event.platform !== "mattermost") return;
    await ctx.reply(`Echo: ${event.text}`);
  },
});

await runner.start();
```

## Setup

### Bot account + Personal Access Token

1. Sign in as a Mattermost admin.
2. **System Console → Integrations → Bot Accounts** — enable.
3. **Account Settings → Account Settings → Display → Show username 'bot' tag** — optional.
4. Create a bot account (Integrations → Bot Accounts → Add Bot Account).
5. Copy the generated access token (shown once — store securely in `.env`).
6. Add the bot to channels where it should listen.

### Required environment

```
MM_BASE_URL=https://mattermost.acme.com
MM_BOT_TOKEN=<paste-the-token>
```

## Behavior

| Mattermost channel type | Adapter `channel.type` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `D` (Direct Message) | `"dm"` | Always processes inbound. |
| `G` (Group DM) | `"group"` | Requires `@bot` mention by default. |
| `O` (Open / Public) | `"group"` | Requires `@bot` mention by default. |
| `P` (Private) | `"group"` | Requires `@bot` mention by default. |

Thread replies (`root_id` set on the Mattermost post) become `channel.type: "thread"` with `topicId` = root post id. Sending with `type: "thread"` + `topicId: <root>` posts as a thread reply.

### Mention guard (EC-2)

The default `requireMention: true` is enforced via:

1. **`metadata.mentions` array first** — Mattermost's API returns a list of user-ids mentioned in the post. The adapter checks if the bot's user-id is in this list. No ambiguity.
2. **Text regex fallback** — when metadata is absent, the adapter matches `\b@${botUsername}\b` with word boundary. This prevents `@theory_dept` from matching a bot called `theo`.

Override with `requireMention: false` to make the bot respond to every message in every channel it's a member of (loud — use cautiously).

## What's NOT supported in v0.1

| Feature | Status | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| OAuth auth | Deferred to v0.2 (D401) | Use PAT |
| File uploads | Deferred to v0.2 (D404) | `adapter.getClient().uploadFile(...)` (escape hatch) |
| Slash command incoming webhooks | Not supported v0.1 | — |
| Ephemeral / hidden messages | Not supported v0.1 | — |
