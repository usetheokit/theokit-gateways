# Changelog

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Every credential field now says what the platform calls it and where it is issued.

  Measured: a developer who wires one adapter and carries its field name to the next gets
  `error TS2353: … 'token' does not exist in type 'SlackAdapterOptions'`. That names the wrong field
  and the type, and never the right one — so the answer was always one file away.

  These docblocks are on published option types, so an editor now shows the answer on hover and
  completion. All 15 credential-bearing fields across the ten packages are covered, including the ones
  beyond each adapter's primary token: Slack's `appToken`, LINE's `channelSecret`, Vonage's
  `apiSecret` and `signatureSecret`, WhatsApp's `appSecret`.

  **Nothing was renamed.** Six of the ten primary names are the platform's own key, pinned against the
  SDK's own declaration — `channelAccessToken` in `@line/bot-sdk`, `clientSecret` in
  `@microsoft/teams.apps`, `accessToken` in `matrix-js-sdk`, `token` in `grammy` and `discord.js`,
  `authToken` in `twilio`. Where ours diverges, the docblock says so rather than implying otherwise:
  `botToken` (deliberate — the adapter also takes an `appToken`), Mattermost's `accessToken` against
  its client's `token`, and `password` against nodemailer's `pass`.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Drop the unused `@theokit/sdk` peer dependency, so a TheoKit app can install an adapter.

  Every adapter declared `peer @theokit/sdk@^2.18.0` and imported the SDK in **zero** source files.
  The framework ships `@theokit/sdk@4.x`, so `npm install @theokit/gateway-line` into a TheoKit app
  failed outright with `ERESOLVE`.

  The core's range was widened in `@theokit/gateway@0.7.0`, which was not enough on its own: an
  adapter's own manifest still carried the pin, so installing one still failed even against the fixed
  core. Measured in a real app before and after.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- e682180: **A message whose handler throws no longer kills the bot.** On Teams and on WhatsApp's web backend it did — not degraded delivery, an exit code. `Error: ... / Node.js v22.22.2`, and the next message never arrived.

  Both dispatched with `void handler(event)`. `void` reads as "I am not waiting for this"; what it tells the runtime is "I am not handling the error", and under Node 22's default an unhandled rejection ends the process. Measured against both adapters through their own injection seams before the fix, and again after: the throw is now contained, named, and delivery continues.

  **Discord and Telegram contained it but blamed the wrong thing.** The rejection escaped into the platform library's error channel, so a bug in the consumer's own handler surfaced as `[discord] client error` / `[telegram] bot error`. Anyone debugging that went looking in discord.js and grammy for a fault that was in their own code. Both now report `handler threw` and return `"handler_threw"` from the internal dispatch seam.

  **WhatsApp Cloud dropped the rest of the batch, and made the platform resend it.** Meta packs several messages and their delivery receipts into one webhook, and the dispatch loop awaited each handler with nothing around it. One throw skipped every remaining message in the payload, skipped the status receipts, and rejected `handleWebhookPayload` — so the caller's route answered 500 and Meta redelivered the whole batch, replaying the messages that had already been handled. That is a duplicate-reply bug reached through a different door than the one fixed in #11. The same method also now answers `false` on a signed body that is not JSON, instead of throwing out of a method whose contract is `true`/`false`.

  **Email gained a net it did not strictly need.** Its drain is written never to reject, and it does not — but both launch sites discard the promise, so that property was the only thing between a future edit and the same fatal rejection, and nothing enforced it. The catch now lives at the site that would pay for it.

  **The contract is written down, and held to.** `BasePlatformAdapter.onInbound` now states it: a handler may throw, and an adapter must contain that throw, report it as the handler's failure rather than the platform's, and keep delivering. Eight of ten adapters had converged on exactly that with nothing recording it. `tests/lint/adapter-contract.test.ts` gains two invariants — every adapter names a handler throw as the handler's, and no adapter launches a user callback with a bare `void` — and both were checked against a deliberately reverted adapter to confirm they fire rather than pass vacuously.

- 8cbf136: **Every published export now carries documentation.** Forty-seven public symbols shipped with no docblock at all, so a consumer hovering `DiscordAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`, `WhatsAppCloudBackend`, `ThreadStore` or any of the error classes got an empty tooltip. Coverage across the eleven packages went from 71.2% to 100% (163/163), measured over the published declarations rather than the source, because a docblock is not documentation until it survives the build.

  The text says what each symbol is for and what constrains it, not what its name already says. `TelegramAdapter` records that a bot cannot enumerate its chats nor speak into one that has not spoken first. `DiscordAdapter` records that reading message content needs a privileged intent enabled in the developer portal, without which every `event.text` arrives empty and nothing says why. `WhatsAppWebBackend` records that it is unofficial and can get a number banned. `shouldDispatchSyncEvent` records that Matrix replays history on sync, which is why a freshly started bot would otherwise answer every message it can still see.

  **`gateway-slack`'s README documented a type that does not exist.** Its usage example imported `GatewayMessageEvent` from `@theokit/gateway`. That name is an internal alias inside the Discord and Telegram adapters (`MessageEvent as GatewayMessageEvent`), never an export. A reader who copied the example got code that did not compile. It now imports `MessageEvent`, which is what `onInbound` actually hands the handler.

  Two docblocks that attached to nothing were reattached: `acquirePidLock` in `gateway-whatsapp` had its documentation stranded thirty lines above, over a different function, and shipped undocumented as a result.

- b8ef098: **Every package now ships the licence it declares.** All twelve manifests in this repository declare `Apache-2.0`, and the repository had no `LICENSE` file at all — not at the root, and not in any package directory except `gateway-email`. So each published tarball asserted a licence while carrying none of its terms, and §4(a) of that licence requires a copy to travel with the distribution. Worse than a missing file: with no licence text anywhere, everything outside the manifests fell back to default copyright, which grants a recipient nothing.

  The text is now at the repository root and inside every publishable package, byte-identical to the canonical Apache License 2.0 with the appendix filled in (`Copyright 2026 usetheo.dev`). The one pre-existing copy, in `gateway-email`, was replaced along with the rest: it carried the same truncated paragraph 4(d) found across the ecosystem, dropping "reasonable and customary use" from the NOTICE clause — a modified body under an unmodified SPDX identifier.

  **The repository moved to the official `usetheokit` organization.** Existing clones and published URLs keep working through GitHub's permanent redirect; the root manifest now declares `Apache-2.0` explicitly rather than leaving the workspace root silent.

- 5bae032: Six defects that broke real conversations, found by testing the adapters against the live platforms instead of against fakes.

  **LINE — no outbound message was ever delivered.** The adapter called the v9 SDK client with positional arguments while that client takes a single request object, so LINE received an empty request and rejected every send with a 400. Upgrade if you use this adapter at all: nothing it sent reached anyone.

  **Telegram — the bot froze on long replies.** Any message over 4096 characters that began with an unclosed code span (a stray backtick) put the splitter into an infinite loop, hanging the process until it ran out of memory. Long agent answers now split correctly whatever markdown they contain.

  **Mattermost — long messages silently vanished.** The adapter never split anything, so any reply over 16,383 characters was rejected by the server and the user simply saw nothing. Long replies are now split into parts Mattermost accepts.

  **SMS — long messages were rejected from the hundredth part onward.** The `(i/N)` prefix outgrew the space reserved for it, pushing every later part past the provider's limit.

  **Matrix and LINE — `connect()` reported success with an invalid token.** Both now verify the credential with the server before returning `true`, so a wrong token fails at startup instead of silently receiving nothing forever.

  **Email and Teams — the bot could go permanently deaf.** Replacing an inbound handler and then disposing of the previous one removed the new handler as well, and the gateway stopped receiving messages with nothing logged.

  Also: a `pre_inbound` hook that threw put its raw error text into the user's chat, which could expose internal details such as connection strings or tokens. Users now see only which hook failed; the detail goes to the server log, redacted.

  WhatsApp additionally stops opening a second session when `connect()` is called twice, and its group mention filter no longer treats unrelated digits scattered through a message as a mention of the bot.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e926cd9: Align the gateway cluster to the hardened `@theokit/sdk` 2.18.0 Harness (ecosystem M6). Bumped the `@theokit/sdk` peer + dev dependency from `^1.9.0` to `^2.18.0` across all 11 packages. The only consumed SDK surface is `Security.redact` (in the gateway core runner) — a stable public API (ADR D68) unchanged across 1.x→2.x — so the alignment is a pin bump, not a migration. Validated: all 11 packages typecheck + build + test green against 2.18.0 (543 tests passed). No dead/unwired surfaces (`no-stubs-no-mocks-no-wired` checklist clean).
